# Helpers for Grafana plugin development

This repository contains various helper functions that I've found myself reimplementing for my plugins.

## Rationale

My hope is that some of these helpers will make it into the official packages. Others might never be added to Grafana but will still be useful to plugin developers.

## Should I use this package?

You probably stumbled upon this repository because you found an import in one of my plugins. I make **no stability guarantees** of this package. If you find something useful in here, I suggest that you copy-paste it rather than installing this package.
